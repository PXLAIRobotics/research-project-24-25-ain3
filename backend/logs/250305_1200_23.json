  "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do."
