  "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human-like cognitive functions. AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and adapt to new information. They range from simple algorithms to complex neural networks and can be categorized into narrow AI (specific tasks) and general AI (broad human-like capabilities)."
